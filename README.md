# age_estimation_demo
Jupyter notebook with on-line face detection and age estimation. Work done as part of the project at the Summer School on Image Proccessing 2021 in Rijeka.

Please excuse clumsy code and mistakes...

## Models
For face age determination to work, a .caffeemodel and .prototxt files are needed to be fed to OpenCV. They can be obtained from https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR
